Version 1.1.0 – June 1, 2025
Description:
In this version, some bugs in the shopping list have been fixed, where the focus was not shifting as it should.
On some systems, it's not always easy to reload the page, so the header can now be clicked—it also acts as a reload button, although it's a bit hidden.
When deleting a category, a warning is now shown informing you that you are deleting a category and its possible items.
