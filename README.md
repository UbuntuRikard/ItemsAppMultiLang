# Shopping List

The Shopping List is a simple **WPA app** that makes it easy to keep track of your shopping.
With this app, you can plan your trip through your shopping mall, supermarket, or another shopping location.
You can also, with this app, keep track of the items you have at home and where they are located, how much you have, and you can even set a price so you know the value of your little home inventory.
This app is available in the following languages: English, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, German, Spanish, and French.
The app is developed using AI assistants such as Copilot and ChatGPT, where the design and specifications are created by **Rikard Svenningsen**, and programming by **AI.**
**This is my first and second attempt at making an app**
